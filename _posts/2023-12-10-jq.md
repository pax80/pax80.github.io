## What i want to solve?

I need the capability to analyze json data while able to query subsection and manipulate data in a precise and quick way.

I am a fluent python dev, but opening **REPL** to quickly investigate dataset is time consuming.  Create *oneliner* to quickly get things done is what i was looking for.

I see **JQ** as a **sed** for json ðŸ˜ƒ

[Official Documentation and great manual Jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

## Why this blog?

**JQ** is a day to day tool to be use in conjunction with other CLI utilities and allow easy analysis on the fly of API json response

During my learning journey i had different queries that were not answered by the first search on internet. Thus i combined some of the commands i found and i use the most frequently.

> [idea of dataset is ispired by this great talk](https://youtu.be/j6VSAsKAj98?list=PLKTT4cKtfM9HVQMZoAmkQrCQ1G89mydDl&t=1080)

```bash
$ curl -s https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/v8cj-2mjk.json | jq '.[].reservation_start_date' | cut -d "T" -f 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -k 1 -r | head -5
  59 "2023-10-21
  54 "2023-10-28
  38 "2023-12-02
  37 "2023-11-11
  37 "2023-11-04

```

## Hands on

For the simplest example i build a json on the fly and _pipe_ it to **jq**
[The tutorial](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/tutorial/) contains more complex dataset.

```bash
$ echo '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' | jq
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
}
```

> jq with no argument will pretty print the json if valid

---

### **keys** _key-word_

Keys will return the key of the selected object depending on its type.

```bash
$ echo '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' | jq 'keys'
[
  "a",
  "b"
]
```

> keys towards an **object** are the list of keys

---

```bash
$ echo '[{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}]' | jq 'keys'
[
  0,
  1
]
```

> If an **array** is target the keys will be the index of the object

---

### key look-up

```bash
$ echo '{"a": {"b":2, "c":4}, "b": 2}' | jq '.a'
{
   "b": 2,
   "c": 4
}
```

> we are accessing the content of the **object** with key **a**

---

```bash
$ echo '{"a": {"b":2, "c":4}, "b": 2}' | jq '.|{a}'
{
 "a": {
   "b": 2,
   "c": 4
 }
}
```

> - `.` provide the whole object
> - `{a}` request to extract the object with key **a** including the key

## Dataset

For the sake of this blog i will use a [free datset representing countries](http://vocab.nic.in/rest.php/country/json)

Let's **tee** the dataset to a file for easy access.

```bash
curl -s http://vocab.nic.in/rest.php/country/json | tee country.json
```

```bash
$ cat country.json| jq -r '.countries|length'
246
```

> `lenght` count the number of object within the selected section

---

```bash
$ cat country.json| jq '.countries[].country|select(.country_name | test("ITA"))'
{
  "country_id": "IT",
  "country_name": "ITALY"
}
{
  "country_id": "MR",
  "country_name": "MAURITANIA"
}
```
> - `.countries[].country` get all the element in the array `countries ` and select the `country` key
> - `select()` perform a filter
> `.country_name | test("ITA")` 
>     - the filter is based on the `.country_name` field. 
>     - `test("ITA")` mach all the entry with the field containing **ITA**


---

```bash
cat country.json| jq '.countries[].country|select(.country_name=="ITALY")'
{
  "country_id": "IT",
  "country_name": "ITALY"
}
```
> - `==` is a exact match

---


### retrieve the index of objects with field

```bash
$ cat country.json| jq -r '.countries|keys[] as $k| "\($k), \(.[$k]|.country.country_name)"'
0, ANDORRA
1, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
[...]
241, MAYOTTE
242, SOUTH AFRICA
243, ZAMBIA
244, ZIMBABWE
245, INDIA

```

`jq -r '.countries|keys[] as $k| "\($k), \(.[$k]|.country.country_name)"'`

> - `-r`: **from man**: With this option, if the filterÂ´s result is a string then it will be written directly to standard output rather than being formatted as a JSON string with quotes. This can be useful for making jq filters talk to non-JSON-based systems.
> - `.countries|`: extract the top level object with key **countries**
> - `keys[] as $k|`: the key extract index for the array and assign this to a variable `$k`
> - `"\($k), \(.[$k]|.country.country_name)"`: this is a print statement. We print key(index) and look up of the key and get `country_name as result`

JQ has also a **CSV** primitive

```bash
$ cat country.json| jq -r '.countries|keys[] as $k| "\($k), \(.[$k]|.country.country_name)"|@csv'
jq: error (at <stdin>:0): string ("0, ANDORRA") cannot be csv-formatted, only array
```

>**Gotcha**: 
we need to make sure the output of the query is an array []

```bash
$ cat country.json| jq -r '.countries|keys[] as $k| [$k, .[$k].country.country_name]|@csv'
0,"ANDORRA"
1,"UNITED ARAB EMIRATES"
2,"AFGHANISTAN"
3,"ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA"
4,"ANGUILLA"
5,"ALBANIA"
6,"ARMENIA"
7,"NETHERLANDS ANTILLES"
```

> Now the output is a list of arrays
> - `[$k, .[$k].country.country_name]`

---

Output by interpolating strings.

This allow for a more readable output.
```bash
$ cat country.json| jq -r '.countries[].country|"country id: "+ .country_id +" ----> full name: "+ .country_name'
country id: AD ----> full name: ANDORRA
country id: AE ----> full name: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
country id: AF ----> full name: AFGHANISTAN
country id: AG ----> full name: ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
country id: AI ----> full name: ANGUILLA
country id: AL ----> full name: ALBANIA
country id: AM ----> full name: ARMENIA
country id: AN ----> full name: NETHERLANDS ANTILLES
country id: AO ----> full name: ANGOLA
country id: AQ ----> full name: ANTARCTICA
country id: AR ----> full name: ARGENTINA
country id: AS ----> full name: AMERICAN SAMOA
country id: AT ----> full name: AUSTRIA
country id: AU ----> full name: AUSTRALIA
country id: AW ----> full name: ARUBA
country id: AX ----> full name: Ã…LAND ISLANDS
country id: AZ ----> full name: AZERBAIJAN
country id: BA ----> full name: BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
country id: BB ----> full name: BARBADOS
country id: BD ----> full name: BANGLADESH
country id: BE ----> full name: BELGIUM
country id: BF ----> full name: BURKINA FASO
country id: BG ----> full name: BULGARIA
c

```

> interpolation is down `+ "text" +`

## Conclusion


**Key summary**:

- **jq** allow to query any json object
- extract the output and format according to the user need
- build with the similar **Unix Philosophy** where we can build a complex query by piping them one after another


**My experience**:

I was able to learn the tool by constant experimentation and seek to fulfill my curiosity. 
There are tons of resources online, but the most important one for me is continuous practice (*katas*).
