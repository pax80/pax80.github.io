# Vim marks

> This is not a feature you use if you are new to **VIM** as it may feel too advance.

> Thinks of **marks** as bookmark that allow to record location where you want to go in a later stage.

```bash
                 _            _
                (a)          (c)
                 |      _     |
                 |     (b)    |
            .....|......|.....|...........
          .      v      |     v         .
         .     Loc1     |   Loc3       .
        .               v             .
       .              Loc2           .
      .                             .
      ..............................
```

## How to

### Basic

- `ma` -> create a mar a on local buffer
- `` `a `` -> go to the location line & columns of mark a
- `'a` -> go to the line of mark a
- `:marks` -> list marks

### Operators with marks

We can use any operator with the local **marks**.
This allow to perform the given operation from where the cursor is located to the _line_ `'` or **line and column** `` ` ``

We can use the

- `c'a`
- ``c`a``
- `d'a`
- ``d`a``
- `y'a`
- ``y`a``

Example:

We can make uppercase from cursor to the marker


> we set the mark `m` to the specific line

`` gU`m ``

- `` gU `` -> make upper case
- `` `m `` -> until the mark m

## Location

### local

These are identified by _lower case letters a-z_

Each buffer can have its own marks.

We can have mark `a` for each _buffer_.
The local marks are remember until the buffer is in the buffer list. Once the session is closed the local marks are gone.

```bash

     +----------+     +----------+    +----------+
     |buffer 1  |     |buffer 2  |    |buffer 3  |
     |          |     |          |    |          |
     |line 1  a |     |line 1    |    |line 1  b |
     |line 2  b |     |line 2  a |    |line 2    |
     |line 3  c |     |line 3  b |    |line 3  c |
     |line 4  . |     |line 4  c |    |line 4    |
     |line 5  . |     |line 5    |    |line 5  a |
     +----------+     +----------+    +----------+

```

### Global

These are saved within session.
If you restart vim and you type `` `J `` if the **J** mark was saved previously you will open the mark at the same _line_ and _columns_ of the previous save.

```bash

     +----------+
     |File 1    |
     |          |    +----------+
     |line 1    |    |File 3    |
     |line 2  J |    |          |    +----------+
     |line 3  ^ |    |line 1    |    |File 3    |
     |line 4  . |    |line 2    |    |          |
     |line 5  . |    |line 3    |    |line 1  L |
     +--------.-+    |line 4  K |    |line 2  ^ |
              .      |line 5  ^ |    |line 3  . |
              .      +--------.-+    |line 4  . |
              .               .      |line 5  . |
              .               .      +--------.-+
              .               .               .
 `J............               .               .
                              .               .
 `K............................               .
                                              .
 `L............................................
```

### Use case

[Harpoon plug in](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) show the usage of the Global marks to quickly navigate within different files.

Even tough this plug in is great. It is overkill for my daily use case. I took the idea and narrow down to my usage.

Make remap to use CTRL with `J` `K` `L` to navigate between 3 Global marks.

Configurations

> ```bash
> # vimscript config
> nnoremap <C-j> `J
> nnoremap <C-k> `K
> nnoremap <C-l> `L
> ```

> ```bash
> # lua config
> vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-j>", "`J")
> vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-k>", "`K")
> vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-l>", "`L")
> ```
